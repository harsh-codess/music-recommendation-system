## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Content-based recommendations using song title, genre, lyrics, etc.
- 🧠 NLP vectorization with TF-IDF / Word2Vec / BERT
- ⚡ Fast and efficient similarity matching (e.g., cosine similarity)
- 🖥️ Optional web interface using Flask or Streamlit
- 🔧 Easily extendable for collaborative filtering, deep learning models, or API integration

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Gensim** – ML & NLP modeling
- **TF-IDF / Word2Vec / BERT** – Text vectorization
- **Flask / Streamlit** – Web app (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Prototyping and experiments

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean text (remove stopwords, lowercase, lemmatize)
   - Prepare metadata (title, artist, genre, lyrics)

2. **Vectorization**  
   - Convert text to vectors using TF-IDF / Word2Vec / BERT

3. **Similarity Calculation**  
   - Compute similarity matrix using cosine similarity or ANN search

4. **Recommendation Output**  
   - Given a song title, return top N most similar songs
